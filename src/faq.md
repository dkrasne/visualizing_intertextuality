# Frequently Asked Questions

**Who is the intended audience of this project?**

The primary intended audience is all scholars and students of Latin poetry who have an interest in intertextuality.

**Which author do I select for poems in the *Appendix Vergiliana*, or poems with disputed authorship, like the *Hercules Oetaeus*?**

All works with uncertain or disputed authorial attribution (including unattributed fragments) can be found by selecting &lsquo;Anonymous works&rsquo; in the dropdown menu for Author. However, works such as the [*Hercules Oetaeus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules_Oetaeus), which has traditionally (but probably incorrectly) been attributed to Seneca, or works such as the [*Culex*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendix_Vergiliana#Culex_(%22The_Gnat%22)), which is transmitted as part of the [*Appendix Vergiliana*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendix_Vergiliana) and was believed by ancient Roman authors to be an early work of Vergil, will *also* be found by selecting the relevant author&mdash;such works will be listed with brackets around the title. In the diagrams, they are shown without an author, or as &ldquo;anonymous&rdquo;. Conversely, poems by distinct pseudonymous (but not spurious) authors, such as [Lygdamus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lygdamus), will be listed under the pseudonym, not under &lsquo;Anonymous works&rsquo;.

**Who chooses the intertexts for the database?**

The goal is eventually to include *all* published (and thus peer-reviewed) word-level intertexts in the database. Plausible intertexts that have not been published are not included (but can be added if they are published!). The *order* in which they are added depends on many factors, and the work is slow.
