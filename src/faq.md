# Frequently Asked (or Expected) Questions

**Who is the intended audience of this project?**

The primary intended audience is all scholars and students of Latin poetry who have an interest in intertextuality.

**Which author do I select for poems in the *Appendix Vergiliana*, or poems with disputed authorship, like the *Hercules Oetaeus*?**

All works with uncertain or disputed authorial attribution (including unattributed fragments) can be found by selecting &lsquo;Anonymous works&rsquo; in the dropdown menu for Author. However, works such as the [*Hercules Oetaeus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercules_Oetaeus), which has traditionally (but probably incorrectly) been attributed to Seneca, or works such as the [*Culex*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendix_Vergiliana#Culex_(%22The_Gnat%22)), which is transmitted as part of the [*Appendix Vergiliana*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendix_Vergiliana) and was believed by ancient Roman authors to be an early work of Vergil, will *also* be found by selecting the relevant author&mdash;such works will be listed with brackets around the title. In the diagrams, they are shown without an author, or as &ldquo;anonymous&rdquo;. Conversely, poems by distinct pseudonymous (but not spurious) authors, such as [Lygdamus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lygdamus), will be listed under the pseudonym, not under &lsquo;Anonymous works&rsquo;.

**How do I view extranumerical lines (such as 845a, which would come between 845 and 846)?**

If a given extranumerical line has any words in the database, it will always show up along with the canonical line that precedes it. (So, for example, if the main visualization is set to show just Valerius Flaccus, *Argonautica* 1.829, it will in fact show lines 829 and 829a; and a request for *Arg*. 1.829&ndash;830 would show lines 829, 829a, and 830.) There is no way to view *only* the extranumerical line.

**How are alternative textual readings handled?**

When there is a choice between readings that affects an intertext (either because competing intertexts have been proposed for two different readings or because a reading that is only used in some modern editions has a proposed intertext), there is an option to choose between words.

**Who chooses the intertexts for the database?**

The goal is eventually to include *all* published (and thus peer-reviewed) word-level intertexts in the database. Plausible intertexts that have not been published are not included (but can be added if they are published!). The *order* in which they are added depends on many factors, and the work is slow.
